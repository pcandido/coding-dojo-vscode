The Coding Dojo Extension for Visual Studio Code is a simple, but powerful tool designed to facilitate and enhance coding dojo sessions. It provides a seamless and efficient way to manage participant lists, rotation, and timer functionality, ensuring smooth and productive coding sessions.

## Features

* **Participant List Management**: Easily create and manage a list of participants for your coding dojo sessions. The initially provided list will be shuffled for the session.
* **Rotation Management**: At the end of each turn, the rotation will occur automatically, but it is also possible for the facilitator to perform the rotation.
* **Timer Functionality**: Choose the time for each turn and see the timer running in the status bar. While the timer is stopped, the bar will be highlighted in color.

## Installation

## Usage
